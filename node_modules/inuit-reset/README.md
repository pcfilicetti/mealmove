# Reset

The inuitcss `reset` module is a considered approach to resetting elements. It
selectively removes margins and paddings from certain elements, and provides
some sensible defaults for some others.

Install using Bower:

    $ bower install --save inuit-reset

Install using npm:

    $ npm install --save inuit-reset
